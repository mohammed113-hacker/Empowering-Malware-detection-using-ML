# Introduction:

Malware continues to pose a significant threat to computer systems, making effective detection crucial for safeguarding digital environments. This project presents an innovative approach to empowering malware detection through the application of machine learning techniques. The focus lies on training four distinct machine learning models using a dataset comprising Portable Executable (PE) header values from two classes: legitimate and malware files. The project 
workflow involves preprocessing the dataset, extracting relevant features from PE headers, selecting appropriate machine learning models, training and evaluating these models,and finally deploying them within a web server environment. Upon deployment, the system enables real-time malware detection by extracting PE header values from executable (exe) or dynamic-link library (dll) files uploaded to the web interface and feeding them into the trained machine learning models.

# Proposed Unique Approach

The Portable Executable (PE) header of an Executable (EXE) file serves as a rich source of metadata that encapsulates crucial information about the file's structure, functionality, and behavior. PE header values, such as file attributes, machine architecture, sizes of different sections, entry point address, version information, and many others offer a comprehensive view of the executable's properties. These attributes can be indicative of malicious behavior, such as obfuscation techniques, packer usage, or anomaly in section sizes, which can be leveraged by machine learning algorithms to differentiate between legitimate and malicious EXE files. Through
extensive exploration of feature extraction methods, the project seeks to capture unique  malware attributes within the PE header values and train different machine learning model with those attributes. Ultimately, the trained models will be deployed within a web-based architecture to facilitate real-time malware detection.
