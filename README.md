Introduction:
Malware continues to pose a significant threat to computer systems, making 
effective detection crucial for safeguarding digital environments. This project 
presents an innovative approach to empowering malware detection through the 
application of machine learning techniques. The focus lies on training four distinct 
machine learning models using a dataset comprising Portable Executable (PE) 
header values from two classes: legitimate and malware files. The project 
workflow involves preprocessing the dataset, extracting relevant features from PE 
headers, selecting appropriate machine learning models, training and evaluating 
these models, and finally deploying them within a web server environment. Upon 
deployment, the system enables real-time malware detection by extracting PE 
header values from executable (exe) or dynamic-link library (dll) files uploaded to 
the web interface and feeding them into the trained machine learning models.
